First application, a POKEDEX, made with JS, Bootstrap, HTML & CSS
When you hover on each of the buttons, the name of the Pokemon appears, if you click then a picture of them with their height pops up in a container.

At the bottom you can find buttons that link to my first portfolio website & my Github profile
